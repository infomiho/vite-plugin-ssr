import { Link, Warning, RepoLink } from '@brillout/docpress'

The `guard()` hook together with <Link href="/render" text={<code>throw render()</code>}></Link> and <Link href="/redirect" text={<code>throw redirect()</code>}></Link> enables you to protect pages.

The most common use cases being authentication and authorization, see <Link href="/auth#login-flow" />.

Note that:

- It's always used together with `throw render()` or `throw redirect()`. (The `guard()` hook doesn't accept any return value.)
- It can be asynchronous. (Unlike Route Functions which are always synchronous.)
- A single `guard()` hook can apply to multiple pages.
