You can use `throw render()` to:

```ts
// Render the error page
render(statusCode: 401 | 403 | 404 | 429 | 500 | 503, info?: string | Record<string, unknown>)
// Render another page (while preserving the URL, unlike redirect() which changes the URL)
render(url: `/${string}`, info?: string | Record<string, unknown>)
```
 - If the first argument is a URL, then that URL is rendered (while preserving the current URL)
 - If the first argument is a status code, then the <Link text="error page" href="/error-page" /> is rendered.
   - [`401` Unauthorized](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401) - Access denied, because the user isn't logged in.
   - [`403` Forbidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403) - Access denied, because the user is logged in but isn't allowed.
   - [`404` Not Found](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) - Page doesn't exist.
   - [`429` Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) - Purposeful rate limiting, because of pricing limit or to protect from [DDoS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).
   - [`500` Internal Server Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500) - Your app has a bug.
   - [`503` Service Unavailable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503) - Your server is overloaded and/or a third-party API isn't responding.
 - If `info` is a string, then it sets `pageContext.abortReason` which is typically used by the error page to show a message to the user, see <Link href="/error-page" />.
 - If `info` is an object, then it sets `pageContext` values. For example:
   ```js
   const abortReason = `Movie with ID ${id} doesn't exist.`
   render(404, abortReason)
   // Is equivalent to:
   render(404, { abortReason })
   ```

While it's most commonly used with a [`guard()`](/guard) or [`onBeforeRender()`](/onBeforeRender) hook, you can use it with any hook.

The most common use cases being:

- Authentication and authorization, see <Link href="/auth#login-flow" />.
- Data fetching error handling, see <Link href="/data-fetching#error-handling" />.

See also:

- <Link href="/redirect" />
- <Link text={<><code>render()</code> VS <code>redirect()</code></>} href="/abort#render-vs-redirect" />, which one to use depends on your use case.
- <Link text="Do not swallow" href="/abort#do-not-swallow" /> `throw render()` otherwise it won't work.
